# ANZ-virtual-internship-task
Dataset:

This task is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 monthsâ€™ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.

Task 1 (EDA)

Used Pandas to segregate customer data by each month and used Matplotlib to visualise transaction volume and mean transaction amount each day. Also visualised mean customer balance and mean payment amount by age, with gender means included, for each month in data set.

Task 2 (Predictive Analytics)

Explore correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes (e.g. age). These attributes could be those that are readily available in the data (e.g. age) or those that you construct or derive yourself (e.g. those relating to purchasing behaviour). Visualise any interesting correlations using a scatter plot.

Build a simple regression model to predict the annual salary for each customer using the attributes you identified above
